# Welcome

NPC engine is an inference engine that allows you to design game NPC AI using natural language.  

It uses state of the art deep learning models and allows you to:

* Generate NPC lines based on the natural language descriptions of a character (e.g. his persona, location).
* Voice those lines with multiple voices (current model has 127)
* Trigger discrete actions based on semantic similarity between an action description and a player or NPC line.
* Create an API to your own deep learning models.

## Use npc-engine
[Unity](https://npc-engine.github.io/npc-engine-unity/){ .md-button  } [Unreal Engine 4](not_ready.md){ .md-button  } [Godot](not_ready.md){ .md-button  }  [Other](inference_engine/overview#creating-an-integration){ .md-button .md-button-primary }

## Extend npc-engine
[Export model using existing API](inference_engine/models.md){ .md-button .md-button-primary }  [Add new API](inference_engine/api_classes.md){ .md-button  }
