But don't get discouraged, it's quite easy to create!  
Check out the [integration checklist](../inference_engine/overview#creating-an-integration).

If you plan to create one, please consider contributing!

To contribute a new integration:

- Create an issue to discuss the integration architecture with us.
- Develop the integration, preferably with demo scene. 
- Share it with permissive open source license.
- Create a pull request to npc-engine repo with documentation about your integration.
